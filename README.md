Tic-Tac-Toe Web Game
A browser-based two-player XO (Tic-Tac-Toe) game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can enter their names, select their playing symbol (X or O), and play a responsive turn-based game. The application handles win conditions, draws, and game restarts with visual feedback and styled animations. Ideal for demonstrating front-end development skills and DOM-based interactivity.
